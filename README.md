# Frontend Mentor - Calculator app


The project was based on the challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).



This is a solution to the [Calculator app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29/hub/calculator-app-Jwe-D6TTH). 

## The design provided

![Design preview for Calculator app coding challenge](documentation/design/desktop-preview.jpg)



I was using design files provided for this challenge in order to make the result look as similar as possible to the provided images.

I have also added various breakpoints in order to provide the best user experience.

The solution to this challenge can be accessed by this [link](https://iuliiakonovalova.github.io/frontend-mentor-calculator-app-main/)

## Features

+ ### Main Page

    - Represent: 

        * the calculator app.
        ![Main Page](documentation/app_features/main_page.png)

    - Consist Logo and toggle:

        ![Logo](documentation/app_features/calc_logo.png)

        * Logo of the app on the left side.

        ![Theme Toggle](documentation/app_features/theme_toggle.png)

        * Theme toggle allows user to pick preferable calculator's theme from 1 to 3.

            When the user click on the numbers of theme toggle, the theme would change immediately.

          1. Theme 1

              ![Theme 1](documentation/app_features/theme_1.png)

          1. Theme 2

              ![Theme 2](documentation/app_features/theme_2.png)

          1. Theme 3

              ![Theme 3](documentation/app_features/theme_3.png)

    - Consist the calculator
    
    ![Main Calculator](documentation/app_features/theme_1.png)

    Including:

    - Calculator display where the user can see the operations:

    ![Calculator Display](documentation/app_features/calc_screen.png)

    ![Calculator Operation](documentation/app_features/calc_screen_operation.png)

    - Keyboard: 

        ![Calculator Display](documentation/app_features/keyboard.png)

        Which includes following keys: **0-9**, **X(*)**, **+**, **-**, **/**, **Delete**, **Reset**, **=**.
        User can use keys on the screen, as well as the stationary keyboard.

        *Notice*:
        - If the user wants to use '=' on the stationary keyboard, he/she needs to click 'Enter';
        - If the user wants to use 'DEL' on the stationary keyboard, he/she needs to click 'Backspace';
        - If the user wants to use 'RESET' on the stationary keyboard, he/she needs to click 'Esc';
        - If the user wants to add operation to the computation, the previous result (with which user wants to make another operation with) will be seen on the top of the screen.
        - If the user wants to make a new operation with new numbers after computing previously, the new numbers will be add automatically without the need to click 'RESET' or 'DEL'.

    * It the end of the page the user can find the credits section with links to the company's website, which created the challenge and the github of the coder of this web app

## Bugs
+ **Solved bugs**

1. The keydown event didn't work properly when the user clicked keys on the keyboard. The computation was failing since numbers were sum as a JS string

    - *Solutions:* value was changed to string.
    
    ```javascript
    if (event.key === '3') {
      calculator.appendNumber('3')
      calculator.updateDisplay()
    };
    ```

1. After hitting '=' key on the screen and 'Enter' on the keyboard, the user could add numbers to the result of the computation, rather than start a new operation

    - *Solutions:* Add global variable to ```class Calculator``` to store the result of computation. To check whether the user would add another operation to the result of the computation, or will input a new number.
    
    ```javascript
    class Calculator {
      tempNum = 0;
      constructor(prevNum, curNum) {
        this.prevNum = prevNum;
        this.curNum = curNum;
        this.clear();
      }
    }

    ```
1. If the user divides by 0, using stationary keyboard, the result was '0'.

    - *Solutions:* Add if statement to ```compute()```:
    
    ```javascript
        if (previous !== 0 && current === 0) {
          calcResult = 'âˆž'
        }

    ```

1. If the user input. at the very beginning of the number, the calculator didn't convert it into '0.'.

    - *Solutions:* Add if statement to ```appendNumber()```:
    
    ```javascript
    else if (number === '.') {
      // Check if there is only one . in the user's input
      if (number === '.' && this.currentOperand.includes('.')) return;
      // If not, add 0 automatically before .
      this.currentOperand = '0.'
    }

    ```

1. The user couldn't change the operation after clicking on one.

    - *Solutions:* Add if statement to ```chooseOperator()```:
    
    ```javascript
    //Check whether another operation was called
    if (this.operation !== '') {
      this.operation = operation;
    }

    ```
